## Setup (2 minutes)

### 1. Install the extension

```bash
# In a regular terminal (not inside Pi)
pi install npm:@codexstar/pi-listen
```

### 2. Choose your backend

pi-listen supports two transcription backends:

| | Deepgram (cloud) | Local models (offline) |
|---|---|---|
| **How it works** | Live streaming — text appears as you speak | Batch mode — transcribes after you finish recording |
| **Setup** | API key required | No API key, models auto-download on first use |
| **Internet** | Required | Not required after model download |
| **Latency** | Real-time interim results | 2–10 seconds after recording stops |
| **Languages** | 56+ with live streaming | Depends on model (1–57 languages) |
| **Cost** | $200 free credit (lasts 6–12 months for most developers) | Free forever |

Run `/voice-settings` inside Pi to choose your backend and configure everything from one panel.

#### Option A: Deepgram (recommended for live streaming)

Sign up at [dpgr.am/pi-voice](https://dpgr.am/pi-voice) — $200 free credit, no card needed.

```bash
pi
# Inside Pi:
/login deepgram
```

Pi resolves the saved credential when each session starts. On macOS, the login
flow stores the key in the login Keychain and keeps only a Keychain lookup in
Pi's `auth.json`. `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` remains available as an environment fallback.

#### Option B: Local models (fully offline)

No setup needed — run `/voice-settings`, switch backend to Local, and select a model. It downloads automatically.

> **Note:** Local models use batch mode — they transcribe after you finish recording, not while you speak. For live streaming as you speak, use Deepgram.

### 3. Open Pi

On first launch, pi-listen checks your setup and tells you what's ready:
- Backend configured (Deepgram key or local model)
- Audio capture tool detected (sox, ffmpeg, or arecord)
- If everything checks out, voice activates immediately

### Audio capture

pi-listen auto-detects your audio tool. No manual install needed if you already have sox or ffmpeg.

| Priority | Tool | Platforms | Install |
|----------|------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | **SoX** (`rec`) | macOS, Linux, Windows | `brew install sox` / `apt install sox` / `choco install sox` |
| 2 | **ffmpeg** | macOS, Linux, Windows | `brew install ffmpeg` / `apt install ffmpeg` |
| 3 | **arecord** | Linux only | Pre-installed (ALSA) |

---

## Settings Panel

All configuration lives in one place: `/voice-settings`. Four tabs cover everything you need.

### General — backend, language, scope

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codexstar69/pi-listen/main/assets/settings-general.png" alt="General settings — backend, model, language, scope, voice toggle" width="600" />

Toggle between Deepgram (cloud, live streaming) and Local (offline, batch mode). Change language, scope, and enable/disable voice — all with keyboard shortcuts.

### Models — browse, search, install

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codexstar69/pi-listen/main/assets/settings-models.png" alt="Models tab — browse 19 models with accuracy/speed ratings" width="600" />

Browse 19 models from Parakeet, Whisper, Moonshine, SenseVoice, and GigaAM. Each model shows accuracy and speed ratings (●●●●○/●●●●○), fitness badges, and download status. Fuzzy search to find models fast. Press Enter to activate and download.

### Downloaded — manage installed models

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codexstar69/pi-listen/main/assets/settings-downloaded.png" alt="Downloaded tab — manage installed models, activate or delete" width="600" />

See what's installed, total disk usage, and which model is active. Press Enter to activate, `x` to delete. Models from [Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/handy) are auto-detected and can be imported without re-downloading.

### Device — hardware profile and dependencies

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codexstar69/pi-listen/main/assets/settings-device.png" alt="Device tab — hardware profile, dependencies, disk space" width="600" />

See your hardware profile (RAM, CPU, GPU), dependency status (sherpa-onnx runtime), available disk space, and total downloaded models. Model recommendations are based on this profile.

## Usage

### Keybindings

| Action | Key | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|
| **Record to editor** | Hold `SPACE` (≥1.2s) | Release to finalize. Pre-records during warmup so you don't miss words. |
| **Toggle recording** | `Ctrl+Shift+V` | Works in all terminals — press to start, press again to stop. |
| **Clear editor** | `Escape` × 2 | Double-tap within 500ms to clear all text. |

### How recording works

1. **Hold SPACE** — warmup countdown appears, audio capture starts immediately (pre-recording)
2. **Keep holding** — live transcription streams into the editor (Deepgram) or audio buffers (local)
3. **Release SPACE** — recording continues for 1.5s (tail recording) to catch your last word, then finalizes
4. Text appears in the editor, ready to send

### How local models work

```
Hold SPACE, or set `shortcutMode` to `push` to replace it with the configured shortcut
                ↓
Audio captured to memory buffer
Release SPACE → buffer sent to sherpa-onnx (in-process)
                ↓
         ONNX inference on CPU (2–10 seconds)
                ↓
         Final transcript inserted into editor
```

Models download automatically on first use. Downloads are resumable, verified after completion, and deduplicated (no double-downloads). The settings panel shows real-time download progress with speed and ETA.

Models from [Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/handy) (`~/Library/Application Support/com.pais.handy/models/`) are auto-detected and can be imported via symlink (zero disk duplication).

```

---

## Configuration

Settings stored in Pi's settings files under the `voice` key:

| Scope | Path |
|-------|------|
| Global | `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` |
| Project | `<project>/.pi/settings.json` |

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "version": 2,
    "enabled": true,
    "language": "en",
    "backend": "local",
    "localModel": "parakeet-v3",
    "scope": "global",
    "onboarding": { "completed": true, "schemaVersion": 2 }
  }
}
```

`DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` from your shell is used at runtime and is not copied back
into `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`. If you paste a key during onboarding, that is
an explicit save and it still goes to `~/.env.secrets` or `~/.zshrc`.

---

## Troubleshooting

Run `/voice test` inside Pi for full diagnostics.

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "DEEPGRAM_API_KEY not set" | Run `/login deepgram`, then retry dictation. |
| "No audio capture tool found" | `brew install sox` or `brew install ffmpeg` |
| Space doesn't activate voice | Run `/voice-settings` — voice may be disabled |
| Local model not transcribing | Check `/voice-settings` → Device tab for sherpa-onnx status |
| Download failed | Partial downloads auto-resume on retry. Check disk space in Device tab. |
| `dyld: Library not loaded: libsimdjson` on macOS | Homebrew Node ABI mismatch — run `brew reinstall node` or switch to version-managed Node (`mise`, `fnm`, `nvm`) |

---

## Security

- **Cloud STT** — audio is sent to Deepgram for transcription (Deepgram backend only)
- **Local STT** — audio never leaves your machine (local backend)
- **No telemetry** — pi-listen does not collect or transmit usage data
- **API key** — resolved through Pi provider auth and never logged. macOS stores `/login deepgram` keys in the login Keychain.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting.
